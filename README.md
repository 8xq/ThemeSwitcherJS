# ThemeSwitcherJS
```
This is a basic JavaScript project that allows you to switch between a 'Light' & 'Dark' mode via a button / toggle
This uses colour themes defined rather than applying CSS classes to existing elements so it easy to manage :)

## How to change 'Themes' ?
```
In style.css your 'base' colours can be set (this is the base theme that will load with no JS)
Theme.js is where you can edit the 'colours' set in :root and as you can see below here is the way I use them !
Note you can change these variable names if needed

BG => 'Background' colour
SG => 'Secondary' colour
EC => 'Extra' colour
TX => 'Text' colour
```

## Colour schemes
```
If you do change the colours used I recommend using a "Colour scheme" to generate pairs of colours that match
It is recommended to not use too many different colours also :)
